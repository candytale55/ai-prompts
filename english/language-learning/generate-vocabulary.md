I'm going to give you the list of words in Portuguese, plus its English counterpart, type, meaning and an example sentence in English.
This is just so you can infer the right meaning.

It's common vocabulary that I want to use in a speaking activity where I'm going to describe a childhood memory. I'm going to describe a
situation or event, and the feelings they produced on me. The childhood memory is a festival or celebration. If there's a better word in
Portuguese for it, you can change the Portuguese word as long as the meaning remains the same.
